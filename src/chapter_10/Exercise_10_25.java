New string split method: The split method in the String class returns an array of
string consisting of the substrings split by the delimiters. However, the delimiters are not
returned, Implement the following new method that returns an array of strings consisting
of the substrings split by the matching delimiters, including the matching delimiters.
public static String[] split(String s, String regex)
For example: split(“ab#12#453”, “#”) returns ab, #, 12, #, 453 in an array of string, and
split(“a?b?gf#e”, “[?#]”) returns a,?,b,?,gf,#,e
